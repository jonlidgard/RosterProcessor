Thoughts on re-writing rosterprocessor

Use of javascript libraries such as 'Prototype' will help improbe OO coding.

Can re-write parser as:

1/ Javascript state machine
    Advantages:  Completely self enclosed in extension.
                Doesn't require a web server to be used.
                Should be fairly future proof.
                Could be used in a Safari extension

    Disadvantges:
                Harder to write & debug -(Maybe develop an Xcode widgit for easier debugging?)
                Not readily portable to other platforms (iphone, android).
                Relies on update mechanism to introduce new versions

    To investigate:
                Can javascript be called from iphone webkit ?
                javascript to iphone code conversion utilitly

2/ XPCOM
    Advantages:
                Can be written in c & ported to iphone easily
                Easier debugging - use xcode

    Disadvantges:
                Have to build firefox
                Rebuild & update for new firefox versions - heavy maintenance


    To investigate: Ptyhon XPCOM
            Have to build xpi's for each supported firefox version since pythonext is different for each
                and for each platform.
                Not yet available for FF4.
                Future support unknown

3/  Server based parsing

    Advantages:
            Easier to code
            Could be called from all platforms
            All users using latest code
            Can use SMC state machine compiler

    Disadvantges:
            Relies on keeping a web server up & running
            Possible cost implication
            Data will have to be encrypted or a SSL connection used.

    To investigate:
            Use of virgin webspace & php - traffic limit ?
            Amazon - could use Java - code already partly written.

Virgin - php 4.3 - not good version for OO design & limited libraries
php is probably the most flexible in terms of free or cheap hosting. All hosting services provide it.
php can be called from the command line & is easily integrated with a debugger (x-debug).
